    "#### Question outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many _reports_, one report per line. Each report is a list of numbers called _levels_ that are separated by spaces. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "7 6 4 2 1\n",
    "1 2 7 8 9\n",
    "9 7 6 2 1\n",
    "1 3 2 4 5\n",
    "8 6 4 4 1\n",
    "1 3 6 7 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are _safe_. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The levels are either _all increasing_ or _all decreasing_.\n",
    "- Any two adjacent levels differ by _at least one_ and _at most three_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `7 6 4 2 1`: _Safe_ because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.\n",
    "- `1 2 7 8 9`: _Unsafe_ because `2 7` is an increase of 5.\n",
    "- `9 7 6 2 1`: _Unsafe_ because `6 2` is a decrease of 4.\n",
    "- `1 3 2 4 5`: _Unsafe_ because `1 3` is increasing but `3 2` is decreasing.\n",
    "- `8 6 4 4 1`: _Unsafe_ because `4 4` is neither an increase or a decrease.\n",
    "- `1 3 6 7 9`: _Safe_ because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example, `_2_` reports are _safe_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. _How many reports are safe?_\n"

    "If we get to the end of the 5th element and criteria for Safe is met, increment the results sum by 1\n",
